# Portfolio
This Portfolio is a tracker for my progress throughout the MSU Bootcamp. Currently, I have links to several sections, including previous work.

## Getting Started
This Portfolio is very simple to set up.
Step...  
1.) Download/Clone the website to your local repo.  
2.) Open the HTML file in the web browser of your choice, preferably Chrome.  

If you'd prefer to simply view the website, it is up on this following link!
